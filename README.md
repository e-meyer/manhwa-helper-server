### Manhwa Alert Server

This is going **to** be the scraper server for the [manhwa-alert-app](https://github.com/e-meyer/manhwa-helper-app) project.
It's currently just a basic scrape testing.

I've tried Node.js for scraping but noticed that Python with Flask performs somewhat better.

Also, I've implemented some workarounds for specific scanlators because scraping certain functionalities can be tricky. For example, when there's no actual search page available, analyzing the network traffic can come in handy.
